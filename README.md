## Prerequisite

### You will be working off of your previous iterations of your Personal Bio site.

## Requirements

### Make your personal site what you want.
> Your portfolio site will be a touchpoint for potential employers. Employers value knowing about you, your projects, and your skills. It's time to show them off. You now have free reign on the styling of your portfolio site. You may use whatever CSS framework (or none) that you want. The only requirement for this is that you include a bio, contact information, a listing of projects and a listing of blogs.

Use this ruberic to guide you:
##### About
	- Is it easy to find the personal bio?
	- Does the personal bio tell the story:
		- Why do they want to go into development
		- What they love about development
		- What makes them a good developer
	- General look and usability
	
##### Contact
	- Is it easy to find the contact information
	- Do all of the links work
	- General look and usability

##### Projects
	- Is it easy to find where the projects are
	- Do all the projects have real content/not fake data	
	- Do all of the links work

##### General look and feel of the whole site
